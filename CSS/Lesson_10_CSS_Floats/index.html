        <p>When creating animations and other GPU-heavy actions, it's important to understand the willchange attribute.
        Both CSS keyframes and the transition property use GPU acceleration.</p>
        <p>Performance is increased by offloading calculations to the device's GPU. This is done by creating paint layers (parts of the
            page that are individually rendered) that are offloaded to the GPU to be calculated. The willchange property tells the browser what will animate, allowing the browser to create smaller paint
            areas, thus increasing performance.</p> 
    </section>
    <div class="clear">Float</div>
    
    <p>The will-change property accepts a comma-separated list of properties to be animated. For
       example, if you plan on transforming an object and changing its opacity, you would specify:</p>
    <div class="block right">Float</div>
</body>
